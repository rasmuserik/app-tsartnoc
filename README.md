# ![logo](https://solsort.com/_logo.png) MiniLD#36: Contrasts

Entry for [MiniLD#36](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/07/01/mini-ld-36-contrasts/).

### Try it in Chrome/Firefox at <http://tsartnoc.solsort.com/>.

Works in recent Chrome/Firefox/... will probably fail miserably with other browsers.

A simple game where you collect tokens and avoid monsters.

Goal:

- get to as high a level as possible before getting eaten

Features:

- game engine written from scratch in 4 days
- improvised jazzy music <http://solsort.com/tsar_tnoc/audio/jazzy.ogg>
- original odd graphics
- procedural level generation
- focus was more on prototyping experiment than actual game...
